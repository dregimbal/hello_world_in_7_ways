Hello world in 7 ways 


This repo is a joke between friends 

Recruiters seem to want developers who can use any language thrown at them, and what better way to prove my prowess than to write the bare minimum program in a bunch of languages 

Feel free to make pull requests 

Loosely categorized into:
- Text documents (txt, .md, .json, html)
- Scripted/interpreted languages (JS, bash)
- Compiled langues (typescript, java, c#)
- Miscellaneous/memes (images, folder structure)
